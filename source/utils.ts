            - The "|" separates this into two expressions, as in A or B.
            - "^\s+" matches a sequence of one or more whitespace characters at the beginning of a string.
            - "\s+$" is the same thing, but at the end of the string.
            - "g" makes is global, so we get all the whitespace.
